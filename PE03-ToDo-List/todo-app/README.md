# ToDo React Appliaction 

## Input:
created a ToDo List app that takes user input as a ToDo description entered into in input field where user can type task description and click on add task button to add inti ToDo list. I also added a delete button with a ToDo list to remove a specific ToDo task.

## Process:
The app uses the useState hook for state management. It maintains two state variables: one for the current task description entered by the user and another for an array of ToDos. When the add task button is clicked, a new ToDo object is created with a unique ID and description, and it is added to the array of ToDos using the setTodos function. Similarly, clicking the delete button will remove the corersponding ToDo from the list.  

## output: 
The ToDo List App allows users to add tasks, remove tasks, and see the list of tasks on the screen. Users can enter task descriptions, click "Add Task" to add them, and click "Delete" to remove specific tasks.
